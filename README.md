# ENHANCING-PEDESTRIAN-TRACKING-ACCURACY-AND-RELIABILITY-USING-SORT-ALGORITHM-IN-MATLAB
The SORT method and tracking in computer vision are new tracking algorithms. No matter how fast or slow things move, this is quite successful for real-time tracking applications. In addition, it is very flexible and rainproof. This MATLAB code example demonstrates the use of the SORT method to track pedestrians in a random data set. To obtain reliable estimates, the code iterates through all parts of the method, such as tracker algorithms and Kalman filter algorithms, and develops association cost functions describing how to measure a simple, explicitly used in practice, based on ACF (aggregate channel units) analysis, to evaluate algorithm performance (Alsuwian et al., 2022). This study provides a detailed assessment of the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of the algorithm to solve real-world tracking problems. Practitioners and researchers can benefit from a fuller understanding of the complexity of the SORT process with significant contributions from this research. This is a valuable resource for anyone looking for effective ways to target multiple goals.

# System Design

The system design offers an excellent requirement for addressing the intricate needs of making use of a simple online and real-time tracking (SORT) system for pedestrian surveillance. This guarantees precision and effectiveness while figuring out pedestrians. The primary goals of this work encompass integrating seek statistics from the aggregate channel feature approach (ACF), optimizing SORT settings, carefully optimizing Kalman filters for estimation, and robustly defining the defining the main objectives.

# Success in Project

The main purpose of my team was to work on the detection object process by YoloV4 with a Tiny version and a Full version (288 to 416). We used in this program SORT algorithm for accurate tracking and efficient outcomes (e.g. Threshold Values and Accuracy as well as BBoxes(Boundary Boxes for pedestrians or other objects). We completed this project successfully (like my accuracy was 95% or my threshold value in 0.5). The detection portion and tracking part work on multiple objects and pedestrian movements detected by cameras or we give a path for MOT17 dataset input the program for more accuracy.
